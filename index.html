              It’s necessary for the color blocks to have an outer div
              (.float-child) in order to add space and also have both blocks fit
              side by side. Well, what if we only had the .float-child divs
              without padding, and instead tried to add space by putting a
              margin-right value on the first block like this?
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">2 / 4</div>
        <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="images/IMG_20190917_221323_1.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item grid-item-right">
            <p>
              Then each .float-child element has a thinner red border and some
              more padding. Then the actual color blocks are child elements of
              the .float-child elements. (You’ll see why in a bit.) To position
              the divs side by side, we are using the float property to float
              each .float-child element to the left. Since they are both
              floating to the left, they will display side by side if there’s
              enough space for both to fit. They do fit because we have two
              .float-child divs, each at 50% width.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">3 / 4</div>
        <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="images/IMG_20191105_125314_7.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item grid-item-right">
            <p>
              In this case, both .float-child elements would take up 50% of the
              total width. But the first green element would also have a margin
              of 20px. This would mean that both blocks would take up 50% + 20px
              + 50% width. This would be 20px more than 100% width, meaning
              there’s not enough room for both to be side by side. The second
              blue block would then wrap to the next row underneath the first
              block, and float to the left there:
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">4 / 4</div>
        <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="images/IMG_20191209_134908_6.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item grid-item-right">
            <p>
              You can try to tweak the widths so they are 48% or some other
              number less than 50% to fit them. But it won’t be exact. That’s
              why I personally like wrapping the blocks in an outer div set at
              50% width, with padding to add the space between the divs.
              Nowadays, it’s easier to use other, newer methods in CSS to place
              divs side by side rather than with float. Let’s take a look at one
              of these: the flexbox method!
